RUN THESE COMMANDS TO FIX THE ERRORS:

cd /mnt/d/compliFi/dashboard

# Install new dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Restart the dev server
npm start

This will:
1. Install crypto-browserify and stream-browserify polyfills
2. Install react-app-rewired to configure webpack
3. Configure webpack to use the polyfills
4. Fix the "Module not found: crypto/stream" errors
5. Remove unused import warnings

Expected output when it works:
"Compiled successfully!
Local: http://localhost:3000"

The warnings about @reown source maps are harmless - they won't prevent the app from working!
